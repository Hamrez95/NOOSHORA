## Branching

- `main`: stable and release-ready only.
- `dev`: integration branch.
- `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`: short-lived branches merged into `dev` by pull request.

## Delivery loop

1. Plan and define acceptance criteria.
2. Implement a vertical product slice.
3. Run automated checks and manual review.
4. Critique from product, UX, technical, sales, warehouse, accounting, and domain perspectives.
5. Fix gaps and repeat until the release gate is met.
